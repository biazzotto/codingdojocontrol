codingdojocontrol
=================

* A simple tool to use during coding dojos

The project target was to create an easy tool
to join two different needs for a coding dojo:

1) countdown timer

2) lighter about code status

After a quick search in Google, no tool could
attend my requirements, so I moved on and 
created this.

Graphical interfaces were created using 
qt4-designer.

TODO:
 * improve configuration
 * create notification GUIs?
 * play a sound once time reaches zero
 * change display collor in the last 10 seconds?
 * world domination
